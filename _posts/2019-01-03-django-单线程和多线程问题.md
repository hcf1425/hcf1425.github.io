# django 单线程和多线程问题

Django itself does not determine whether it runs in one or more threads. This is the job of the server running Django.

The development server used to be single-threaded, but in recent versions it has been made multithreaded. Other servers such as Apache/mod_wsgi, gunicorn, or uwsgi, have their own defaults and can be configured in a number of ways; often they use multiple processes rather than threads.
